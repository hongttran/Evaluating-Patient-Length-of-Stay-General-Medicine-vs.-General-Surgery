<h1>Evaluating Patient Length of Stay in General Medicine vs. General Surgery: Descriptive statistics and data visualization</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves analyzing and evaluating the performance of the General Medicine service line concerning patient length of stay (LOS). The analysis is prompted by concerns from the General Surgery team, which suggests that the General Medicine team's longer LOS may indicate inefficiencies and unnecessary bed utilization. The objective is to provide a data-driven assessment to address these concerns and offer actionable recommendations.

<h3>Interpretations and Findings:</h3>


<b>Why is Internal Medicine LOS Higher Than General Surgery?</b>
<p>General Surgery patients typically follow structured recovery protocols, enabling early discharges after procedures. In contrast, Internal Medicine patients often present with chronic or complex conditions, requiring longer hospital stays for comprehensive management. The higher LOS in Internal Medicine DRGs, such as sepsis and respiratory illnesses, aligns with conditions that demand extended monitoring and treatment to ensure stability before discharge.</p>


<b>External Factors Affecting LOS</b>
<p>Several external factors influence Length of Stay (LOS) in Internal Medicine. Patient complexity plays a major role, as those with heart failure, pneumonia, or sepsis often require prolonged care. Additionally, hospital resources, including ICU bed availability, specialist access, and discharge planning efficiency, directly impact LOS. Insurance and post-discharge planning delays, such as waiting for rehabilitation facility approvals, skilled nursing placements, or home care arrangements, can further extend hospitalization beyond the necessary medical care period.
</p>

<h3>Recommendations & Next Steps</h3>


<b>Short-Term Strategies (Immediate Impact)</b>
- <p>Improve discharge planning by reducing delays in rehab placements, skilled nursing transfers, and home care coordination to ensure timely patient transitions.</p>
- <p>Streamline specialist consults to avoid unnecessary inpatient days waiting for assessments.</p>
- <p></p>Utilize step-down units efficiently to free up higher-acuity beds for critical patients.</p>

<b>Long-Term Strategies (Sustained Improvement)</b>
- <p>Identify Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) with the highest LOS, such as sepsis, respiratory infections, and intracranial hemorrhage, and develop targeted interventions.</p>
- <p> Implement early intervention programs to proactively manage high-risk patients and prevent prolonged hospital stays.</p>
- <p>Enhance hospital resource allocation, including staffing adjustments, ICU bed management, and technology-driven workflow improvements.</p>
